## What and why version control

::: {style="font-size: 30px"}
Version control systems are software tools that help teams manage changes to source code over time.^[https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control]

- Improve work efficiency
- Traceability. Easily turn back and compare previous version
- Collaborate at same time

This workshop will introduce implementing version control using git and github with RStudio as the GUI.
:::


## Connect Rstudio to GitHub and clone the repo to local

At the beginning, we need to use git clone to copy the remote repository we created (e.x. base_code) to our local computer, so we can work locally. 

::: {.callout-important}
Note: Git clone from Rstudio not command line, so it will generate the .Rproj automatically.
::: 

![connect](src/RStudioConnectGitHub.gif)
  
After click **“Create Project”** to create a new directory with same remote repository name on your computer, which will be all of these things:
  
- a .gitignore file
- a .Rhistory file
- an RStudio Project
- renv directory and renv.lock file (package version control)  
- any files already uploaded into the remote repository

## Detect Git from RStudio

* Type `where git` in cmd to get the git executable path
* From RStudio, go to *Tools > Global Options > Git/SVN* and make sure that the box *Git executable* points to your Git executable.
![detect](src/detect.png)

## Package version control Renv
* Current base code library loading has been stripped down to necessary (used) packages only 
* The renv package is used to help us maintain package synchronicity across all project users
  + each project has its own isolated library of R packages inside a subdirectory **renv/library**, so you can upgrade/change package in one project without potentially breaking other projects.
  + the **renv.lock** file registers the package versions used for the project it is in 
  
Set-up steps are in the [documentation](https://interlabsocwa.github.io/CodeDocumentation/#package-dependencies) and [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/renv/vignettes/renv.html), but in essence:  
1. open cloned project in your local workspace, if it has renv & renv.lock,  
  
2. when the project is opened locally, renv should automatically bootstrap & install itself.  It will then prompt user to install the packages (the appropriate versions logged for the project) by running `renv::restore` in the console   
  
::: {.callout-caution}
If your work requires changing versions of packages, please refer to [documentation](https://interlabsocwa.github.io/CodeDocumentation/#package-dependencies).  Consult the team in a timely manner, and log as an [issue](#issues) for future reconciliation.

## The overall workflow graph of version control

The diagram below shows the overall version control workflow for each round.

![workflow](src/workflow.png)

## Folder Location
::: {.column width="39%"}
1. **Remote: **
Github Website: https://github.com/InterlabsOCWA/base_code
:::  
::: {.column width="27%"}
2. **Repository, Index:  **
Git staging area, or  
the "invisible" .git folder within your local location  
No direct manipulation here, git act as stage manager  
:::
::: {.column width="33%"}
3. **Local Workspace:**
Anywhere you like!  
Plus, the **Archive folder location:**
* main: /3_Templates_References/Round_codes
* round: /4_WIP/O103-Interlabs/d_Code 
* develop: /1_QMS
:::

![flow](src/flow.png)

::: {.notes}
Working directory is your code directory
Local repository is .git folder in Working directory
Remote repository is bare repository on server or in the filesystem
:::

## Commit{#commit}
Commit are "saves" snapshots of your work locally (separate from "minor" quick-saves e.g. in RStudio).  Typically, commit once you've validated changed code works, or after substantial changes (which you might need to roll back from).

::: {layout-ncol=2}
![Save points load selection](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTetFiXFFYebqSevAQ4rJ3URBlU2g2VXkDsBQjLCJinfUTGBI2l_P5IE4dsAnmpX4nCWMg&usqp=CAU){#fig-hanno}

![commit history on github](src/commitHash.png){#fig-hanno}
:::


<span style="color:green;">**Commit hash**</span> (a 40-digit "id code", typically used through its shorted 7-digit form) lets you specify the "load file"/version e.g. when rolling back

<span style="color:blue;">**Commit message**</span> is a description of that commit's changes which must be provided by the committing user.  Commits are as useful as the details we provide in the message. 



## gitignore file {#gitignore}

The .gitignore file can tell Git which files and directories to ignore when you make a commit. We can commit and push the .gitinore file to share the ignore rules.

The .gitigonre content writing reference: <https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/06-ignore.html>
   
The data/files we don't want to commit to GitHub:

- Rproj (keep it locally)
- all the data spreadsheet - Not sure, might be different 

![datafolder](src/datafolder.png)

# What happens in each branch?
## Main branch
The main branch contains the base code template that will be updated at the end each round, so we need to upload/push the initial files at beginning. 

* After all files settle done, we should not touch this branch. 
* At the end of the round, a workshop will be hold to compare the files in different branches using **Notepad++/ Pull Request** and decide the merge request before merging the subbranch to main.

![main](src/main.png)

::: {.callout-warning}
People should not switch to main branch and make changes to it during work.
:::  

## Round branch
The round branch contains current round code. For each round, we will create a round branch from main. At the end of this round, create pull request to merge to main branch (Only need to create pull request. Do not need to merge it!).


![round](src/round.png)

### The workflow in round branch:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

1. Make sure you are in round branch 
2. Copy all the code need data folders into your working directory
3. Pull the current files in remote repository to local
4. Edit the code and commit (save) your changes to local repo
5. Push your commit to remote repo
:::

::: {.column width="4=50%"}
Might need to create **feature** branch based on the issues:

1. Create new feature branch from the issue
2. Do the same steps 1-5 above
3. After complete the feature branch, create Pull request to merge back to the round branch
:::

::::


## Develop branch
The code refactoring work will in this branch. At the end of this round, create pull request to merge to main branch (Only need to create pull request. Do not need to merge it!).

### The workflow for develop branch: 

1. Make sure you are in develop branch
2. Copy the data folder into your working directory
3. Do the [branch workflow](#branch_workflow) steps.

For each refactor or feature creation cycle, create **feature** branch based on the [issues](#issues):

1. Create new feature branch from the issue
2. Do the [branch workflow](#branch_workflow) steps.
3. After complete the feature branch, create Pull request to merge back to the develop branch
4. May have [code review](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-git-and-github-in-a-team-like-a-pro/) after the pull request

## Issues (enhancements, bugs) -> Feature sub-branches {#issues}
Log issues (including bugs and features suggestions) and assign staff to resolve in the github [Issues tab]((https://github.com/InterlabsOCWA/base_code/issues).  Issues automatically get "sticky-noted" on the [project board](https://github.com/users/InterlabsOCWA/projects/2/views/3?filterQuery=-status%3ATodo).

![Issues inventory](src/issuesListKanban.png)
Issues are repository wide (i.e. cannot be "created" specific to a branch). To aid tracking, the title of the issue should state the specific branch it is for.   

Title: *Branch*-*Type*_*Descriptor*  
Where Branch = *branch name* e.g. should primarily develop unless you are reporting a bug on the round branch
Where Type = feature OR bug OR refactor, for example
Where Descriptor = short human-readable descriptor of request

## Creating an issue and associated feature branch
* Provide appropriate name, details, then,  
**click on the gear icons on the right panel of the github issue page to add the following)**  
* *Label* appropriately by branch and any other help tags at the right panel
* Assign *Project* (usually "@InterlabsOCWA's BaseCode"), *Assignee* at the right panel
* Provide sufficient context in the *comment* for others to be able to follow up  
* if this is a new feature, once the issue is submitted and there is no resource to tackle the feature addition, the user should (reload the issue page) create a new branch for it under the development section, right panel).  The branch should be a branch off from the develop branch, as illustrated below.     
![Issues creation and syntax](img/githubIssuesBranch.gif)
  
*when updating, provide commit hash if it is tied to a specific upload version- github will automatically link to that committed version.  

# Version Control actions {#branch_workflow}

## Overall flow chart

The image below shows a overall git flow chart, git action commands traverse the different work locations.
![flow](src/flow.png)

## Repository
We will need a repository to store all the files.

- The local repository is a Git repository that is stored on our computer 
- The remote repository is stored on some remote computer. 

At the beginning of the project, we need to create a remote repository in GitHub. 

For the most part, we will be working in the base_code repository at <https://github.com/InterlabsOCWA/base_code>


## Create branches

To work on different versions/add new feature to the code, we need to branch off the specific branch we want to work on. It will copy all the files in the branch at that point in time.

::: {.callout-important}
Remember to select which branch you want to branch off **AND** Pull it to your local after you create branch !!
:::
    
There are three ways to create a new branch in both local and remote:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- 1) From GitHub:
![gitbranch](src/GitHubBranch.gif)
  
  
- 3) From GitHub Issues  
**more details in issues/features section**
:::

::: {.column width="4=50%"}
- 2) From Rstudio:

Switch to the branch you want to branch off ([see switch branch section](#branch_workflow) in branch workflow) then create branch followed by below image.
      
![Rbranch](src/RBranch.png)
:::

::::
   

## 1. Switch to corresponding branch

Since different people can be working on different branches, before starting our work, we need to switch to our [working branch](#vc-project-workflow). There are two methods to switch between branch:

* In Rstudio:

    Select the remote branch you want to work on by clicking the bottom (see image below), it will automatically create and switch to that local branch.
  
    ![Rbranch](src/SwitchBranch.png)
     
* In Shell: type `$ git checkout <branch_name>` in terminal

## 2. Pull from remote

To start working on a project, pull any new changes to update local copy. If there is a merge conflict see [merge_conflict section](#merge_conflict).

* In Rstudio: Click the **Pull** bottom in the **Git** tab section

* In Shell: type `$ git pull` in terminal

## 3. Make changes and commit

* After finishing changes, click on the **Git** tab in RStudio. It will show the files that have changed or added.

![git](src/git.png)
---
* Click on the **Commit**, it will show the window in below image. Click the staged box to stage the file you want to push to remote. You can see the difference between the files after you click the file (show blue line). Lines that have been added are green. Lines that have been removed are red.

![diff](src/diff.png)

* Add a commit message and click on **Commit** in this window. Every time make a commit, must also write a short **commit message**.
    
* You can view the history of your commit after click the left corner **History** beside the change. You can also view the commit history in other Git client app. Or check your past commits though type `git log` in terminal.

::: {.callout-note}
For the files you don't want to push to Github you can list the them in [**.gitignore** file](#gitignore).
:::

## Git state 

* Check on the state of the Git world: type `git status` in terminal



## 4. Push

When you are finished and committed, remember to **Push** these changes to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub). Should see 'HEAD -> branch' if successfully pushed. 

::: {.callout-note}
You might need to pull again before push, if someone pushed their work to remote during your work.
::: 
   
## Pull Request and Merge Changes between branches - Edit Later {#pullrequest}

Each time you want to merge/pull a branch from another branch, you will need to create a pull request. Sometimes it will show up automatically in the branch web page after you push, if not you need to do it manually.

* For the first auto case, you will see a notice to create a pull request (see the image below). Then click on the button that says **Compare and pull request** to go next step. 

* For the manual case, first need to click the **Pull request** tab. Then click the button that says **New pull request**. It will show up the **Compare changes** page, you need to decide the pull direction. The compare branch is the one you want to pull from. Base is the branch will be changed. After decide the branches, click **Create pull request** button and go next step.

* Now both case are in the same **Open a pull request** page, and click on **Create pull request** to compare and merge them.

           
* GitHub has now compared the two versions of the project that are in the two branches. If there is no conflict it is telling us that there are no conflicts between the two versions and you can click the green **Merge pull request** button to merge the changes.

* If you don't need the branch (e.x. feature branch), click **Confirm merge**. Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been incorporated, with the **Delete branch** button in the purple box.
![success](src/successMerge.png)

The manual pull request process: ![manual](src/manualpullrequest.gif)

## Merge conflict {#merge_conflict}
There will be a merge conflict when you pull from the remote but have done some new work locally since the last time you pulled:

* Recent commit history of origin/main: A--B--C
    
* Recent commit history of the local main branch: A--B--D

It will show the warning below and automatically add the two version with markers in that file.
    
    'CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in ...(the file have conflict)
    Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.'      
      
* The code between the <<<<<<< HEAD and ======= line is the content you committed in your local and the code between the ======= and >>>>>>> line is the content in the current remote branch.

![marker](src/mergeconflict.png)

* Keep the version you want and remove the all the markers line (<<<<<<< HEAD:, ======, >>>>>>) inserted to demarcate the conflicts then save the file and do the following commit and push again.
